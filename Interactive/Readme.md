# Part 3 - An interactive visualiser. 
Export your objects from your modelling package into the template graphics API code and create an interactive showcase to show your objects and attributes. You will need to add an exploration camera (moves with keys or has a defined path â€“ not static), simple materials, lights, shaders and keystroke interactions to make your objects alive (e.g. add moving objects, loop interactions, changes
in lights, wind, etc.).
