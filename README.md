F20GA - 3D Graphics &amp; Animation Coursework

## Introduction

This project centers on creating a detailed isometric room, designed to showcase various 3D modeling, texturing, and rendering techniques. The main idea is to develop a cohesive, stylized environment that captures the essence of a furnished room with a consistent visual theme. Each object in the room — including a chair, wardrobe, bed, plant, table, and lamp — has been modeled and textured to maintain a unified aesthetic. 

The isometric perspective offers a unique view that emphasizes the spatial arrangement and depth of the scene, making each object easily visible while contributing to the room's overall atmosphere. Lighting and camera setup play a crucial role, using a balanced 3-point lighting system and strategically placed spotlights to highlight textures, materials, and shadows, further enhancing realism. The final render is intended to provide an immersive, visually engaging representation of the room, where each element complements the theme and contributes to the scene's look. This project combines creativity with technical precision, resulting in a polished, high-quality 3D room render.
