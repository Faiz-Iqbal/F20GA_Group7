# Part 1 - High-quality offline rendering of your objects.
This deliverable is composed of rendered images of objects, at least one per member of the
group, plus work necessary to create common background models, lights, materials and the scene. All rendered images should have a common
theme and match a common style. You will need to show your incremental work for this deliverable (e.g., sketches, early models, pre-renders).
