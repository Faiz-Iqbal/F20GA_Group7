# Part 1 - High-quality Offline Rendering of Objects

This deliverable consists of rendered images showcasing each object, created by individual group members, alongside shared background models, lighting, materials, and overall scene setup. All rendered images are designed to fit a cohesive theme and style. Incremental work, including sketches, early models, and pre-renders, will also be documented.

## 1 - Chair and Wardrobe  

### Modelling Process  

#### Chair Body  
The chair body was modeled from a basic cube, reshaped into an "L" by removing the top and front faces. Subdivision and solidify modifiers were applied to create a smooth, rounded finish. Loop cuts were added to define cushion edges, and the backrest was beveled for a softer look. In sculpt mode, dips and bulges were added for a cushion effect, enhanced with a cloth filter for softness.

#### Metal Rod, Legs, and Wheels  
The metal rod started as a cylinder, shaped with inset and extrusions to form sturdy ridges. Legs and wheels were modeled as cylindrical shapes with inset, extrusion, and loop cuts to create sections. The wheels and legs were combined into one object, duplicated with an array modifier, and rotated evenly using an empty object as a reference.

### Textures  

For the chair body, a leather texture was created using high-scale Noise Texture for grain and a Color Ramp for a warm brown color, with a Bump Node adding subtle surface imperfections. The metal rod texture used a procedural Noise Texture with FBM for fine detail, and a Color Ramp provided subtle color variation. The legsâ€™ matte plastic texture was created with high- and low-scale Noise Textures for grain and diffuse patterns, while Color Ramps adjusted color variations, and a Bump Node added surface depth. Roughness was set to 1.0 for a realistic matte finish.

### Lighting & Camera  
All objects are positioned slightly above the ground to emphasize shadow effects from the 3-point lighting setup.

## 2 - Bed and Plant  

### Modelling Process  

#### Bed  
The bed frame was modeled from a scaled cube, with an extrusion on top for the headboard. A bevel modifier was applied to smooth the edges. The mattress was created by scaling a cube, subdividing it, and adding cloth physics for a cushion effect, along with a collision modifier. Pillows were modeled similarly to the mattress, excluding the collision modifier. For the bedsheet, a plane was added, subdivided, and cloth physics were applied. The plane was rotated on the Y-axis before running the simulation to create natural wrinkles. A solidify modifier was then added to provide thickness.

#### Plant  
The plant's leaves were modeled from a scaled cube, with edge loops and a subdivision modifier for added detail. Leaves were duplicated and layered to create a natural arrangement. The pot was created from a circle mesh, shaped with extrusions, and the dirt was made from another circle mesh with subdivisions and a displace modifier to add roughness.

### Textures  

For the bed, the frame was textured with procedural nodes to create a wood effect, using noise and color for grain, along with bump and displacement for added detail. The mattress texture was kept simple, as it is mostly hidden. The bedsheet texture utilized a woven fabric pattern, created with two Wave Textures (aligned on the X and Y axes) connected through a Texture Coordinate node, combined with a Mix Node and enhanced with a Bump Node for surface detail. The pillows used image textures for color, roughness, and displacement, connected to a BSDF Shader. 

For the plant, a mix of diffuse and glossy shaders was applied to the leaves for a subtle shine. The pot used a noise texture with a bump node for texture. The dirt was textured with a noise texture and bump node for a rough, realistic look.
